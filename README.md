Features
-----------------

**General**

* Multiplatform: Anddroid, iOS, HTML5
* Free and open source software: Licensed under GPLv3.
* Multilingual: User can select between Aranese, Catalan, Casillian, French, and English.
* Optimized for outdoor use: Works offline with minimal battery drain

**Route Selection Activity**

* Displays large map with each route marked with one icon.
* When user taps the route icon, basic information about the route is displayed in a popup.
* When user taps again, the app changes to "explorer" mode, giving user options to follow the selected route (1) without any background location tracking, or (2) with background location tracking, with locations "snapped" to the route itself. A third option will be available for "expert" users who enter the app initially with a code: These users will also be able to track themselves along whatever path they follow in order to create new routes for future use. (Non-expert users do not have this free-form tracking option because we want to discourage people from hiking off established trails.)
